In this folder, I will have 'miscelaneous' programs; programs that
will help me achieve different tasks that aren't necessarily related
to training the network. Examples can be:
- Listing phonemes in a dictionary
- Getting a list of audios which contain a keyword
- Converting audios to spectrograms
- Checking a transcript
- Reconfiguring root-path in a transcript
- etc.
