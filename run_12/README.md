In this run (developing step), we are migrating to GitHub. We are setting
everything up to be able to run with Speech Commands, TIMIT, Kaggle, TTS
and AOLME.

Kaggle's link: kaggle.com/bryanpark/spanish-single-speaker-speech-dataset
TTS was obtained using TTSMP3.com and github.com/pndurette/gTTS
AOLME was obtained at the University of New Mexico aolme.unm.edu
