# End-to-end Speech Recognition of Spanish and English in Collaborative Learning Environments
Originally, this project was based on keyword recognition (keyword spotting), but it switched to end-to-end speech recognition. The folder src contains the procedures and model used to train a CNN-RNN network on Spanish and English (separately or jointly). This work goes hand in hand with "Spanish and English Phoneme Recognition by Training on Simulated Classroom Audio Recordings of Collaborative Learning Environments" by Mario J. Esparza. After downloading and properly configuring, experiments can be run in LibriSpeech, TIMIT, CSS10 and Speech Commands. The labels of the network are based on phonemes. We use the module Phonemizer by bootphon to "phonemize" text transcripts.
