Implementation to run a speech recognizer in Spanish or English (separately or jointly) using phonemes as labels. Network architecture is based on Michael Nguyenâ€™s implementation: https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/end-to-end-speech-recognition-pytorch.

TODO: give a brief description of the code's overall procedure. Including pre-processing.

TODO: add miscellaneous folder (pre-processing techniques). Currently, it is only available in the develop branch.
